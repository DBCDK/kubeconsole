# kubeconsole
Lowkey shell overlay for making life with kubectl a bit more bearable

It requires normal bash, jq and (need I say it?) kubectl with a 'config'
in '~/.kube'.

To get started: run 'kubeconsole -c' to get help on getting a kubeconfig.

No further documentation, but you may find the command "help" or 'kubeconsole -h' usefull ;)

---

Please keep this simple - this is not supposed to be a huge tool that
can fix the whole world, just make life a bit more easy.

Please dont push to master, use normal Git flow.

Please dont hang me for the huge amount of redundancy and too-simple
bash'ing, it's just a tool that has been banged together over a single
lab-day with too much coffee in the blood.
